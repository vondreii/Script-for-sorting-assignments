# Script-for-sorting-assignments

Still working in progress

This script automates some parts of the marking process (such as sorting and organising)
This includes:
	- Unzipping all student assignments automatically 
	- Creating a copy of the assignment specs for each student, stored in their own folders
	- Renaming all feedback files
	- Checking who has a late submission
