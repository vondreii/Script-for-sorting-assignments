# Script for sorting assignments

Work in Progress

This script automates some parts of the marking process (such as sorting and organising) in order to save time.
This includes:
	* Unzipping all student assignments automatically 
	* Creating a copy of the assignment specs for each student, stored in their own folders
	* Renaming all feedback files
	* Checking who has a late submission
