# sorting-script

Work in Progress

This script automates some parts of the marking process (such as sorting and organising) in order to save time.
This includes:
1. Unzipping all student submissions automatically 
2. Creating a copy of the marking guide for each student, stored in their own folders
3. Renaming all feedback files
4. Checking who has a late submission 

This only works with the zip files generated from UONline (Blackboard) - University of Newcastle, and certain assignment submission file formats.
